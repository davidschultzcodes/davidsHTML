            Here are the lyrics to "Billie Jean" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson" title="michael jackson's wiki" target="_blank">Michael Jackson</a>: She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
            I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
            Who will dance on the floor in the round?
            She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
            She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
            Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
            Who will dance on the floor in the round
            People always told me be careful of what you do
            And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
            And mother always told me be careful of who you love
            And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
            Billie Jean is not my lover
            She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
            But the kid is not my son
            She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
            For forty days and forty nights
            The law was on her side
            But who can stand when she's in demand
            Her schemes and plans
            'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
            So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
            (Do think twice, do think twice)
            She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
            Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh, no)
            'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
            People always told me be careful of what you do
            And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
            She came and stood right by me
            Just the smell of sweet perfume
            This happened much too soon
            She called me to her room
            Billie Jean is not my lover
            She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
            But the kid is not my son
            Billie Jean is not my lover
            She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
            But the kid is not my son
            She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
            She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
            Billie Jean is not my lover
            She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
            But the kid is not my son
            She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
            She says I am the one
            You know what you did, (she says he is my son) breaking my heart babe
            She says I am the one
            Billie Jean is not my lover
            Billie Jean is not my lover
            Billie Jean is not my lover
            Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
            Billie Jean is not my lover
            Billie Jean is not my lover
